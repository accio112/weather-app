This is an app that gives the weather details of an area once you enter a valid address or a pincode of an area.
It can be tested in console with the following commands (enter the address in place of 'address'):
node app.js -a "address"

Note:'Query limit exceeded results' because the API can only grant a certain number of requests at a time.
